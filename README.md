# Pizza Sales Report

In this project I designed an interactive dashboard for the Pizza Sales. With the most desired KPI's from the raw data from the SQL database. There are clear assumes from the visualize data so that the Manager can take a great data driven decision. 

This dashboard will help the sales manager to take a data driven decision to develop pizza sales. Here I  would like to mention some information the dashboard.
KPI's
---------------
1) Total  Revenue ==> This KPI represents the total amount of revenue  in Dollars. 
2) Avg Order Value ==> This KPI represents the average order value.
3) Total Pizza Sales ==> Total Pizza sold in a date range 
4) Total Orders ==> This KPI will present the number of total orders in the selected date range. 
5) Avg Pizza per Order ==> This KPI will represents the number of Pizzas in a order. 

Besides this I also design a  trend on weekdays for total number of orders. There is also a Monthly Trend for total orders that receive the pizza store. 
I showed the % of Pizza category. I showed the % value of total orders by pizza size. 

I also classified the Bad Orders and Good Orders and put into the dashboard.
